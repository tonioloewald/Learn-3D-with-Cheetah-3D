## Scene Graph Shortcuts

**Double-clicking** on the icons of modified meshes or creators “collapses” them (it renders them into an editable mesh). Double-clicking on particle systems creates a static collection of instances (oddly enough, you can swap in new particles, but their positions and such remain the same).

Double-clicking on an object’s name allows you to rename it.

**Drag and Drop** is well-supported. You can drag things into other things to make them children. You can drag tags from one object to another. You can reorder stuff.

**Clicking on an icon** gives you access to its properties, via the properties panel. Clicking on a tag lets you edit that tag’s properties.

**Standard keyboard navigation works** (arrows keys can move around, disclose or collapse nodes, and so forth).
