## Rendering

### Maximum Image Size** Cheetah 3D is currently limited to rendering 5000x5000 pixel images.

### Network Rendering

Because 3D rendering is easily parallelized (i.e. split into multiple independent tasks) an obvious way to accelerate rendering is to use more computers. Cheetah 3D currently lacks support for network rendering, but you can easily take advantage of a few extra computers by simply splitting animations into separate segments and rendering them on separate computers.

### CUDA, OpenCL, GPU-Accelerated Rendering

Even the cheapest modern computers have a GPU — graphics processing unit — which is a very powerful parallel processor. Recently, CUDA and OpenCL have emerged as competing mechanisms for allowing programmers to use GPUs to perform calculations for their programs. Certain kinds of calculations (and rendering algorithms are a good example) are well-suited to being performed by parallel processors, so there is a revolution taking place in GPU-accelerated rendering.

Right now, CUDA is more mature (and several very good CUDA-based renderers are already on the market) but is tied to NVidia’s graphics chips. Since many Macs do not use NVidia graphics chips, this is not very helpful for developers of Mac software. OpenCL promises to be vendor-neutral, but trails CUDA in terms of functionality (even so, some OpenCL accelerated renderers have started to appear).

### Unbiased Rendering, Physically-Based Rendering

_Blender's Cycles renderer in action_

You may have heard of “unbiased” or Physically Based Renderers such as Blender's Cycles, Luxrender (which is an open source unbiased renderer based on code written by the computer scientists who invented unbiased rendering), Maxwell Render, Indigo, Octane, and so on. What these renderers do is randomly shoot photons out of light sources and figure out which ones get to the image being rendered. This is “unbiased” in the sense that it gives every photon an equal chance of contributing to the image, whereas raytracers are biased towards the photons that can be easily determined to reach the view port.

Unbiased rendering involves generating a lot of photons that will not affect the image being rendered, but has the virtue of making many aspects of ray tracing that are very difficult to do correctly “just work”. (The chief way of improving the performance of unbiased renderers is quickly figuring out which photons can be ignored.) E.g. you get caustics and radiosity “for free” with this approach. The major downside to this approach is that there’s no upper bound on rendering time (because you’re randomly sampling photons, you may never get all the photons needed to reach a given level of quality for a specific pixel in the output image).

#### Does this matter to Cheetah 3D Users?

Not really, but…

Cheetah 3D uses some similar techniques to unbiased rendering to render depth of field, soft shadows, blurred reflections, and blurred transparency, and when you render these kinds of effects you end up with noise and artifacts for the same kinds of reasons that unbiased renderers do.

Luxrender ([http://luxrender.net](http://luxrender.net)/) is free, and well worth experimenting with. There are scripts (http://www.cheetah3D.de/forum/showthread.php?t=4374 — which may not currently work) for exporting from Cheetah 3D straight to Luxrender. Alternatively, you can export to Collada or OBJ and then import into Blender (also free) which has excellent Luxrender integration.

### God-Rays, Volumetrics

Volumetrics are mostly-but-not-quite transparent substances such as airborne dust, swirling mist, and smoke. They allow you to render “god ray” effects and other nice visuals.

Cheetah 3D does not currently implement volumetrics.

### Vector Motion Blur

Motion blur is the effect you get when you photograph a moving object — because a camera makes images by capturing light over a period of time, an object moving significantly during that period will appear blurred. When an image is rendered by a computer it will tend to be razor sharp, and motion blur has to be added deliberately. There are a number of ways of doing this including vector motion blur and rendering a bunch of extra frames and averaging them together.

Cheetah 3D does not implement either of these features internally. It’s very easy (although it can take a long time) to render an animation at a high frame rate and then blend the frames together to produce motion blur.
