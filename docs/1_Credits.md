### Image Rights and “Fair Use”

In a number of cases I have made use of images found on the internet. I have tried to use “creative commons” images (and attributed them accordingly) but in some cases I am using copyright material without permission. I consider this to be “fair use”. I am not a lawyer, but I have used this page as a guide: http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html. If notified of a copyright holder’s objection to the use of an image, I will remove it immediately.

Where an image is provided without comment or attribution, then it is entirely my work (with the exception of user interface widgets which appear in some screenshots which are part of Mac OS X, Cheetah 3D, or some other piece of software).

### Feedback and Corrections

This book is — and will probably always be — a work in progress. I know there are errors and omissions in it, and Cheetah 3D itself is a moving target. If you find problems with this book, either mention them on the Cheetah 3D forums, or get in touch with me (http://loewald.com/c3dbook/Contact) via the book’s home page (http://loewald.com/c3dbook).
