## A Quick Tour of Cheetah 3D

The best way to master Cheetah 3D is to play around with it. 

If you’d prefer just to start messing around with Cheetah 3D rather than read hundreds of pages then that's exactly what you should do. This section attempts to provide you with a _just enough knowledge to be dangerous_. Each of the accompanying video “micro-tutorials” lasts less than a minute.

Reading this section is also helpful if you plan to use this book as a resource. Once you understand the points in this section, it should be pretty easy to understand any specific new feature or technique in Cheetah 3D. Well, that’s the goal, anyway.
