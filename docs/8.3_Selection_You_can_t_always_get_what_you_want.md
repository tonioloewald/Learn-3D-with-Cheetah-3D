## Selection: You can’t always get what you want…

But if you try sometime, you just might find, you get what you need! (With apologies to the Rolling Stones.)

Being able to quickly and accurately select the objects or parts of an object you want to work with is a vital part of working in any application. In a word-processor those objects and parts of objects are things like letters, words, and paragraphs. In Cheetah 3d they are objects, pivots, faces, edges, and points.

### Objects vs. Mesh Editing

Cheetah 3D behaves quite differently when you’re in “object mode” (and the things you’re dealing with are line-items in the object browser) versus one of the mesh editing modes (when you’re working inside a specific mesh).

When you’re in object mode, you can only deal with entire objects (including multiple objects). E.g. you might want to select two objects and move, scale, or rotate them together.
